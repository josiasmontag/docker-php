| Variable-first configuration | ❌ | ✅ |
| Production-Ready by default| ❌ | ✅ |
| Built-in security optimizations | ❌ | ✅ |
| Optimized for Laravel & WordPress| ❌ | ✅ |
| NGINX + FPM variation| ❌ | ✅ |
| NGINX Unit variation| ❌ | ✅ |
| Native health checks | ❌ | ✅ |

## What is "Variable-first Configuration" mean?
Our design philosophy is to make it easy to configure your application with environment variables. We took every common configuration option and made it configurable with environment variables, defaulting every single option to production-ready values.

See our [environment variable specifications](/docs/reference/environment-variable-specification) for more information.

## What do you mean "Optimized for Laravel & WordPress?"
We did the hard work of customizing the official PHP image and giving you everything to get started with running PHP's most popular frameworks in seconds. We also hardened the images to help protect your PHP application from common attacks.

## What is "S6 Overlay?"
[S6 Overlay](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay) is a process supervisor designed for containerization from the ground up. It's a modern alternative to [Supervisor (aka Supervisord)](https://supervisord.org/). We only use this in our `serversideup/php:*-fpm-apache` and `serversideup/php:*-fpm-nginx` images, as they require two processes to run a service.
