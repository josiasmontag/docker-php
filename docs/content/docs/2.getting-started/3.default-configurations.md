`serversideup/php` is configured for real-world deployments right out of the box. This saves you many hours so you can launch faster than ever.
::

## Production-ready and optimized for Laravel & WordPress
All values are defaulted to improve security and performance. We also spent the time to carefully review official documentation and include packages that are required specifically for Laravel and WordPress.

## Default PHP Extensions
The following extensions are installed by default:

| **Extension** | **Description** | **Why we included it** |
|---------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| [pcntl](https://www.php.net/manual/en/intro.pcntl.php) | Process Control support in PHP implements the Unix style of process creation, program execution, signal handling and process termination. | This is required for [Laravel queues and Laravel Horizon](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/queues#timeout)|
| [pdo_mysql](https://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.pdo-mysql.php) | The MySQL PDO extension allows you to connect to MySQL databases. | MySQL and MariaDB databases are very popular. |
| [pdo_pgsql](https://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.pdo-pgsql.php) | The PostgreSQL PDO extension allows you to connect to PostgreSQL databases. | PostgreSQL databases are very popular. |
| [redis](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.redis.php) | The Redis extension allows you to connect to Redis databases. | Redis is very popular for caching and it's also required for [Laravel Horizon](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/horizon). Our tests concluded adding this package only added 2MB to the image size. |
| [zip](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.zip.php) | The Zip extension allows you to create and extract zip files. | We included this for the popularity of apps working with ZIP files. This package is also required if you're working with attachments on [Laravel Dusk](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/dusk#attaching-files). |
