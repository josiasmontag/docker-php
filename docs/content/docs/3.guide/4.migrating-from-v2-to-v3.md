# Migrating from v2 → v3
If you're moving from v2 to v3, there are a number of changes you should be aware of. We've tried to keep these to a minimum, but some of these changes were necessary to make the project more maintainable and easier to use.

## ⚠️ Breaking changes
The following changes are considered to be "breaking changes" and will require you to make changes to your application.

### Ubuntu is no longer used as a base image
We now use Debian or Alpine as our base OS (because we're using the official PHP images as a base). This means any extensions to PHP need to be installed the PHP way (not with Ondrej/PHP PPA). If you're using things like `apt-get install php-redis` you will need to change your method of installing PHP extensions.

### `SSL_MODE` is now set to `off` by default (HTTP only)
Running end-to-end SSL by default created more problems than good. By default, we're now shipping HTTP-only by default with the option for people to turn this on.

### `AUTORUN_ENABLED` is now set to `false` by default. 
Having this set to "true" by default also created more problems than good. If you want to use any of the Laravel Automation Scripts, be sure to set this to `true`.

## Variable deprecations
- `WEB_APP_DIRECTORY` has now been renamed to `APP_BASE_DIR`
